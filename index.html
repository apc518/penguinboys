            <li>service apache2 status</li>
            <li>GET just asks a url for some data. POST is used to send some data to the server. HEAD defines the html headers which are essentially metadata for the request</li>
            <li>ServerRoot is where the executable that runs the server lives. DocumentRoot is where the files that are served to the user live.</li>
            <li>Apache defaults to listen on port 80</li>
            <li>Access and Error logs are both stored in /var/logs/apache2. To show the last 10 lines of a file you can use the `tail` command</li>
            <li>In each folder you have an index.html that is a starting point for the server so it knows what to serve.</li>
            <li>You put a .htaccess file in the root of your webpage directory, and put a directive that looks like "ErrorDocument 404 /404.html". You then also must set AllowOverride All in the apache2.conf file under the directory settings for the path to your document root</li>
            <li>First you need to enable the Userdir mod for apache2 using the a2enmod userdir command. Then, the default configuration in httpd-userdir.conf lets you create a public_html directory under the user root and html files can be placed there.</li>
        </ol>
